According to Allen Holub's article, accessor methods (getters and setters) should be used sparingly. 
They can lead to tight coupling (changes affect many classes) and brittle code (less flexible to class-related changes, more difficult to edit). 
Instead, use parameterized constructors (parameters for initializing) and factory methods (static) to control object creation and initialization for better efficiency. 
Accessors should only be used when you need to expose internal state without exposing implementation details.
